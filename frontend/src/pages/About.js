        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          StreetFix was founded on the belief that technology can bridge the gap
          between citizens and their local governments. Our mission is to empower
          individuals to easily report non-emergency issues in their neighborhoods
          and provide municipalities with the tools to efficiently track, manage,
          and resolve these issues, fostering transparency and collaboration.
